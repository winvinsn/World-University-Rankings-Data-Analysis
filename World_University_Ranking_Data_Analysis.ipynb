The dataset includes numerous key indicators, including a school's name, location, region, 2024 and 2025 rankings, size, focus, status, and numerous other miscellaneous rankings, as well as an overall score. These factors provide a comprehensive representation and are taken into account as they were used to map out the overall placement of these institutions. The analysis of this dataset is aimed to provide insights for a range of stakeholders, including students, universities, administrators, etc."

This will better maintain the integrity of the data than filling null values with the median or mean of the column, as carelessly filling values with summary statistics could misrepresent the outputs of our queries.
